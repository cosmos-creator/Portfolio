    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p><span class="hey">Hey there!</span></p>
    <div>
        <p class="its-me">It's me <span class="javed">Javed</span>.
            <br />I'm a coding enthusiast, Recently I enrolled in college for deploma in Computer Engeneering.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>It's been approximately a month since I enrolled there, and it was kinda new experience for me, since I usually
        don't go to places with many people, It overwhelmed me, So many new people and moreover strangers.</p>
    <p>I didn't fit between them, they are too much for me to handle with my personality and personal characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>This might also be due to the fact that I've been alone for a longer period of time than one usually would
        experience in their teenage.</p>
    <p>But unlike others I don't crave interractions and don't need it either.</p>
    <p>Over the course of years and due to pandemic I've become a loner.</p>
    <p>So, this is not too much to say that I've also became a nerd.</p>
    <p>If I were to list out what had changed inside me mentally it would become a long list rather than a intro, so
        let's leave it that :)</p>
    <p>This is a project I've been working on for 2 months and finally it's here a laptop and mobile optimised website.
    </p>
    <p>My own personal website that is also developed by me <span class="happy">^_^</span></p>
